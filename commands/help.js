            Heya you asked for my help so let me give you a brief overview of what i can do.
            i function using regex so you can just include my commands instead of calling them.
            e.g\n\`@dadbot give me a dad joke\` opposed to \`!dadjoke\``);

                let type = c.help.category || "Misc|WIP";
                if(commandMap[type] == undefined)commandMap[type] = [];
                commandMap[type].push(`**${c.help.name}** : \`${c.help.desk}\``);
            });
            if(message.author.id == bot.owner.id && message.content.indexOf("raw") != -1){
